## Consumer Complaints Mini-Project

First, I'll be looking to see the category with the most complaints. 


```{r cars}

data %>% 
  count(product, sort = TRUE)

```

## What complaint category has the biggest increase?

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}

product_count_monthly <-
data %>% 
  count(product, mm_yy_received)

product_count_monthly %>% 
  mutate(product= str_replace(product, "Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports", "Credit reports and repairs"), 
         (product= str_replace(product, "Money transfer, virtual currency, or money service", "Money services"))




```
